To install oracle instant client in a dockerfile you will need to download the rpm files for the version you want to install and add installation steps and environment variables to your dockerfile.

*Note you will also want to include your TNS names .ora file in your image for connecting to a database.

Download RPM Files:

Go to this link for the downloads of basic and sdk(devel) rpm files:

https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html

*Note I have only tested 12.2.0.1.0

you will need to save these in your dockerfile working directory

I suggest the following path hierarchy :

~<dockerfolder>/Oracle

ex. C:\Users\HADIDDX\OneDrive - Abbott\Documents\Test Docker\Oracle

*note remember this location and file names for the dockerfile

TNS Names:

Copy your TNS names file into your dockerfile directory as well to clone into the image.

I recommend ~<dockerfolder>/TNS

ex. C:\Users\HADIDDX\OneDrive - Abbott\Documents\Test Docker\TNS

Docker file code:

First you need to copy your dockerfile directory to the image:

COPY . /<Name to give directory>  *Note a period means copy current working directory
#Copy Files
COPY . /TestDoc #Name of directory
Next you will need to install the drivers using the alien ubuntu package and the option -i:

RUN alien -i <file location/name.filetype>

Ex.
#Install Oracle Client 12.2.0.1.0
RUN alien -i /TestDoc/Oracle/oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
RUN alien -i /TestDoc/Oracle/oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
Lastly you will need to set environment variables for the installation location of the drivers:

##Oracle Drivers
ENV OCI_LIB64=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
ENV OCI_LIB=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
ENV OCI_INC=/usr/include/oracle/12.2/client64
ENV ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64
ENV TNS_ADMIN=/Testdoc/TNS
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64
now you should be able to install ROracle on your image and connect to oracle databases in R.
